# Brickwise Business Plan: Crowdsourced Mortgages & Fractional Real Estate Investments

## Executive Summary
**Concept:** Brickwise is a fintech platform that crowdsources real estate financing – refinancing home mortgages with pooled investor funds and offering fractional ownership in investment properties. The mission is to democratize real estate investing and financing, letting everyday investors and mass affluent individuals participate in opportunities traditionally reserved for banks or wealthy insiders.  

**Services:**  
1. **Crowdsourced Mortgage Refinancing** – homeowners refinance through fractional loans funded by investors.  
2. **Fractional Investment Property Shares** – investors buy stakes in rental properties and earn passive income.  
3. **Alternative Real Estate Funds & Securities** – diversified real-estate-backed funds or REIT-like products.  

**Revenue Streams:** Origination fees, interest spread, property acquisition fees, and asset management fees (recurring).  

**Target Market:** U.S. homeowners, retail investors, and mass-affluent investors. Regulation A+ allows inclusion of non-accredited investors (~80% of households).  

**Competitive Advantage:** One-stop platform combining debt and equity, low barriers to entry, diversification, and strong compliance.
